# Friend Finder

This is an app that emulates dating/socialiing apps, in this case, to find "friends."

### What to expect

Simply press "Go to Survey", and you'll be taken to the survey, where you can agree/disagree on 10 questions, provided you give your name and photo first, and once everything has been filled out press "Submit" at the bottom. A fake "friend" will match with you from a pre-defined list (app/data/friends.js).
